### Hello ! Welcome to our Blog R&D.

It's for you ! Our beloved Community

Through this blog, we propose to discover our R&D backstage.

Our goal is to inform you about Centreon’s developments and experiments. Basically In bulk, we will write about:

* new Centreon’s features
* our favorite technologies
* methodology
* Centreon’s POC
* Opinions and feedbacks on about products
* meetups that we attended
* technologies we are interested in
* And so much more

Functions like “comment an article” will come soon.

Your can follow on twitter [@CentreonLabs](https://twitter.com/CentreonLabs) and come to discuss with the community on the [Centreon Slack](/register-slack).
