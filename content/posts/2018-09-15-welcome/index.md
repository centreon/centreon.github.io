### Hello ! Welcome to our Blog R&D.

It's for you ! Our beloved Community !

Through this blog, we would like to let you in on our work backstage as we hope that it will give you a better understanding of what we are currently working on . This is a new chapter for us and we are thrilled to invite you along for the journey and to build a deeper relationship with all of you, our Centreon users.

As you may be aware, we already launched a Slack workspace a few months ago and there are already more than 190+ members (at the time of writing) who are exchanging knowledge about Centreon on a daily basis. Besides, we have not had the opportunity to say thank you !

So let us take this time to say, to all of you :

Over the years, the Centreon team worked hard to meet your expectations but there is still a lot left to do. That's why we  dedicate our efforts into  improving the product, presenting you with new features, etc. On our way, we will experiment, make mistakes, encounter difficulties and we would like to share with you all of it over the coming months and years via this blog. We will also seek your help and feedback.

But fear not!  We are not going to write only about PHP! We will also share with you our feedback on technologies that we will be trying, on POCs that we will be building, on meetups  and conferences that we will be attending, and so much more.

We are not expecting every post on this blog will sweep you off your feet but we will do our best to keep this blog regularly up to date.

Does this sound interesting to you ?

If it does, then we invite you to become part of our community and give us feedback as we go. We would love to hear from you in the comments on this blog (the feature “comment an article” will come soon), and on our various social media platforms, including Twitter and the Slack workspace.

Your can follow on twitter [@CentreonLabs](https://twitter.com/CentreonLabs) and come to discuss with the community on the [Centreon Slack](/register-slack).

The Centreon R&D Team.
